# Healthcare Analytics Project

## Project Objective

1. **Create and Analyze Dashboards**:
   - Build two interactive dashboards based on the [healthcare dataset](https://github.com/V-i-s-h-n-u-C/Tableau-Healthcare-Analytics/blob/main/Healthcare%20Data.csv).
   - Develop insights from visualizing patient data, including blood pressure, BMI, glucose, insulin, and diabetes status.

2. **Develop a Comprehensive Story**:
   - Create a Story in Tableau that combines the dashboards and additional visualizations to provide a cohesive report on the healthcare data.

### Purpose of Healthcare Analytics
